## 🧠 About Me (aka why I'm always in 10 tabs and 3 terminals)

Heyo! I'm **Michal Schiller**, a 16-year-old tech gremlin who lives somewhere between VSCode and the void.  
I specialize in starting cool projects, vibing with code, and then forgetting about them when a new shiny idea shows up.  
(It's not a bug, it’s a feature.)

Here’s what I *think* I do:

- 🖥️ **C#** – Building tiny tools and desktop wizardry (I break Windows so you don’t have to)
- 📱 **Java/Kotlin** – Once tried to make an Android app... now my phone won’t stop crashing
- 🐍 **Python** – Automating stuff I could easily do manually in 5 minutes... but where’s the fun in that?
- 🌐 **HTML/CSS/JS** – I make websites that may or may not look like they time-traveled from the 90s (on purpose)

## 💾 Current Status: Buffering...

- Working on like, 7 projects at once. Will I finish them? *No.*
- Learning random tech at 3AM and pretending it's productive
- Rewatching old hacker movies for "research"

---

## 🚀 Wanna Collaborate?

If you also:
- Start projects with no end in sight
- Get distracted by tweaking the README instead of coding
- Think blinking cursors are ✨aesthetic✨

Then we’re basically soulmates.

Feel free to explore, fork, star, or just lurk. If you wanna chat, pitch an idea, or send memes, you know where the buttons are.
