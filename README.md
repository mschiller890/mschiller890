I’m a 16-year-old developer who loves **tech, coffee, and unfinished side projects**.  
I spend way too much time building random stuff in **C#, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — and even more time breaking it.

## About Me
- I love experimenting with code and making weird little projects just for fun.  
- Always learning something new (currently: probably debugging something that worked yesterday).  
- Big fan of clean code, messy desks, and old tech aesthetics.
