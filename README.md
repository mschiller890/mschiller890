## About Me (aka why I'm always in 10 tabs and 3 terminals)

Heyo! I'm **Michal Schiller**, a 16-year-old tech gremlin who lives somewhere between VSCode and the void.  
I specialize in starting cool projects, vibing with code, and then forgetting about them when a new shiny idea shows up.  
(It's not a bug, itâ€™s a feature.)

Hereâ€™s what I *think* I do:

-  **C#** â€“ Building tiny tools and desktop wizardry (I break Windows so you donâ€™t have to)
-  **Java/Kotlin** â€“ Once tried to make an Android app... now my phone wonâ€™t stop crashing
-  **Python** â€“ Automating stuff I could easily do manually in 5 minutes... but whereâ€™s the fun in that?
-  **HTML/CSS/JS** â€“ I make websites that may or may not look like they time-traveled from the 90s (on purpose)

##  Wanna Collab?

If you also:
- Start projects with no end in sight
- Get distracted by tweaking the README instead of coding
- Think blinking cursors are âœ¨aestheticâœ¨

Then weâ€™re basically soulmates.

Feel free to explore, fork, star, or just lurk. If you wanna chat, pitch an idea, or send memes, you know where the buttons are.
