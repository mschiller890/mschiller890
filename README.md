## 👾 About Me

Hey there! I'm **Michal Schiller**, a 16-year-old tech enthusiast who's always diving into the world of coding. While I might not always finish my projects (who does, right?), I’m constantly exploring new ideas, experimenting, and learning along the way.

Whether it’s building a random web app, experimenting with code in C#, or tinkering with Python scripts, I'm always up to something new. If you find any of my unfinished projects interesting, feel free to reach out!

### 🚀 Tech Stack
- 💻 **C#** – Building desktop apps and small utilities  
- 📱 **Java & Kotlin** – From small apps to Android development  
- 🐍 **Python** – For scripting, automation, and experimentation  
- 🌐 **HTML, CSS & JS** – Crafting web pages, creative layouts, and interactive features
