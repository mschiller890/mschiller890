# hey,

> build what does not exist.

i am a 17 year old developer who enjoys creating things that start as random ideas and slowly turn into real systems.

my first introduction to programming was writing batch scripts at 9 years old. since then, i have explored multiple languages and environments not just to use them, but to understand how they work underneath.

i am interested in building software that feels intentional: tools, experiments, small systems, and projects that solve problems i notice.

## tech stack

- html / css / javascript  
- python  
- c#

## interests

- custom tools and utilities  
- game development concepts  
- system level tweaks  
- rebuilding existing ideas in my own way  

i am always learning, always experimenting, and always building.

i do not just use software.  
i try to understand it.
